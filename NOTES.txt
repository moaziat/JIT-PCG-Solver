- Poisson's equation: d2u/dv2 = f where v = (x1, x2) in a bounded, open domain
    in R2
    the equation is to be satisfied only for points that are located at the interior of the domain. 
    Equally important are the conditions to be satisfied on the boundary of this physical domain
    Boundary conditions come in three common types: 
        Dirichlet condition u(x) = phi(x)
        Neumann condition du/dn = 0 where n is a unit vector that is normal to boundary and directed outwards
        Cauchy condition du/dn + lambda(x) u(x) = gamma(x)
        (Neumann condition is a particular case of Cauchy condition)

=== Finite difference methods
    the finite difference method is based on local approximations of the partial derivatives in a PDE, 
    which are derived by low order Taylor series expansion.

    ==Finite differnces for 1D problems

    consider 1D equation -d2u/dx2 = f(x) for x in [0, 1], u(0) = u (1) = 0
    the interval [0, 1] can be discretized uniformly by taking n+2 points
     xi = i x h, i=0,....,n+1 where h = 1/(n+1) because of the Dirichlet boundary conditions
        using the centered differnce approximation then: -u(i-1) + 2u(i) - u(i+1) = h**2 f(i)
    for i = 1 and i = n; we have u(0) = u (n+1) = 0
    thus for n = 6, the linear system obtained is of the form of Ax = f
