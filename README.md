##### END GOAL
A small GNN model that computes the PCG
##### Level of difficulty: 
we gonna see, it's doable. 
###### Learning goals: 
discover some HPC concepts, write in C++.
  
##### progress
 - Implemented PCG solver for 2D poisson equation

  - Implemented PCG solver for 2D Laplace equation (just for test and comparaisons)

## NEXT STEP
- CREATE OUR FIRST SMOL GNN? WHAT CHOICE OF GNN? OPTIMAZING WHAT? NUMBER OF ITERATIONS? CHOICE OF THE PRECONDITIONER? in this case I have to implement more solvers and test different preconditioners!
